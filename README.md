# Bubble Fight
BubbleFight is a game based on 99 Balls. This project is still work in progress, but the development is currently paused. You can play the current version of the game [here](https://games.karstenkoehler.de/bubble-fight/).

To build the game yourself, you need [Unity3D](https://games.karstenkoehler.de/bubble-fight/) in version 2018.2.4 (newer versions may also work, though this might require updating the project files). Just `clone` this repository and open it as a Unity project.
